 # Rule 7 - Character Logic.
 Your character is an employee of the space station, loyal to the ideals of the Corporation and his superiors.
 Names and surnames must be appropriate to the context and standards of the RP. Names and surnames of celebrities, actors, characters from movies, TV series, anime, games, etc., as well as similar names and surnames are prohibited.
 SOPs and CLs are in-game rules, but violating them maliciously from round to round may be punishable.
 Also don't forget that your boss, whether captain or CentCom, can fire you, which negatively affects the character's life. Try to listen to your boss and uniquely avoid moments leading to your dismissal.
