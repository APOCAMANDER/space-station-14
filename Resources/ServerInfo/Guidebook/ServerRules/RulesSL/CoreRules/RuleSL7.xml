 # Rule 7 - Self-Antagonism.
 Actions inherent in antagonists are forbidden without a proper role. Calling someone out of the brig for no reason, interfering with a security, etc. is a violation of this rule. Claiming that your character is “unstable”, “crazy”, etc. does not invalidate any of the rules and is not an excuse.
