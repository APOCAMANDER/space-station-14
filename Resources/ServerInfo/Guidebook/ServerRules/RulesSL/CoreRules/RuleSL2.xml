 # Rule 2 - DM/RDM.
 Unjustified actions aimed at causing serious harm to health or killing another person are forbidden. Remember, there must be a very good RP reason for killing. If in doubt, ask in Ahelp. You have the right to self-defense, but it must not escalate to murder. In other words, you have the right to retaliate against your attacker, but when he is already down, you should not kill him. Much less gib.
