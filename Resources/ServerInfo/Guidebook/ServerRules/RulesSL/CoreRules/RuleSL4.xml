 # Rule 4 - Open play.
 For an antagonist, it is usually not worth resorting to open play. Unless that antagonist is explicitly targeting it. Such as: Dragon, Nukeops, Abductor.
 If you can avoid open play, it's best to avoid it. Otherwise, the administration may resort to punishment
 
 Exceptions to the rules:

 - Unavailable target - if your target is unavailable without open play, such as killing a warden. You may play openly.
 - Forced open play - if your play requires open play, such as abductor abductor cases. You can play openly, but it is worth asking permission from the administration.
