 # Rule 9 - Interacting with players who have disengaged from the game or have been granted SSD status.
 SSD players are players who have disconnected from the game or become afk.
 This can be caused by connection problems or other technical issues. Being killed or robbed because of this is not something anyone would enjoy. The goal of killing antagonists by design should be difficult and interesting. Killing an SSD player is not interesting for either the killer or the victim. In case your target is an SSD, don't be afraid to ask for help from the admins in Ahelp.

 Here are the basic rules for behavior with players in SSD:

 - It is forbidden to touch or interact with SSD players except in the following cases: taking them to a cryo-pod, providing medical assistance, or rescuing them from immediate danger (such as carrying them out of a fire).
 - Likewise, if a player with SSD has a “Wanted” status, they may not be detained without the permission of an administrator.
 - If the player went SSD during or immediately after the detention, it is allowed to continue the detention and arrest.
 - Likewise, if you are an antagonist, and if your target has entered SSD immediately after you attacked them, you may continue.
 - If you feel compelled by the situation to interact with a player in the CCB (for example, to retrieve an important piece of equipment from a captain), use Ahelp first.
 - It is forbidden to steal a player's CCB items, except in the following cases: a mission to steal cloaks, medals, figurines and other items that are unique.
