 # Rule 5 - Responsible play for the antagonist.
 The goal of the antagonist is to make the round interesting, exciting, and dangerous, but within reasonable limits. 
 Antagonists are not allowed to wait for players who have just appeared, release plasma, singularity, or generally engage in actions that can be categorized as vulture.
 As an antag, you are only allowed to do what is necessary for your objectives. 
 For example, an abductor is not allowed to steal things from the station or people. 
 A thief should not be killing people in any way. The “die a glorious death” objective negates this rule.
 Remember that “minor” antagonists are stealthy and inconspicuous. There are other, “major” antagonists for open confrontations and high-profile operations. (Rule - 4)
